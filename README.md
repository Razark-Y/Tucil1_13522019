## Installation

Run my project with python or any compiler. Install the library with the code provided below on your terminal.
```bash
  pip install Flask
```

## Deployment

To start , clone this repositories 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Razark-Y/Tucil1_13522019.git
```

To deploy this project on a terminal interface, simply navigate to src, navigate to flask-app and run (Keep in mind that by file input , make sure the file is in the same position as you are currently in)

```bash
  python main.py
```

To deploy this project on a Web interface, navigate to src, navigate to interface, it is better to have a web browser opened, and run
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
then , open another terminal, navigate out from interface and continue to flask-app and simply run
```bash
python app.py
```
## Guides
### Input file method
1. Choose a `.txt` file to upload. Make sure the file follows the correct input format or else error message will appear.
2. After selecting the file, upload it, the status message will then appear.
3. To find solution, click the `Find Solution` button. Once the solution is ready, the Result Box will appear.
4. You are allowed to Save the result as long as a result exist (there is an optimal path).
### Input Random
1. Select the buffer size from the options provided.
2. Input tokes count and its respective unique tokens.
3. Define the dimensions of the matrix by specifying the desired width and height.
4. Determine the number of sequences and max-sequence length.
5. Press the `Find Solution` button to find the optimal path, which will then be displayed in a modal popup window upon completion.
6. You are allowed to Save the result as long as a result exist (there is an optimal path).
7. Keep in mind that any input error will affect the result and in worse case it might lead to error or no solution.
### Manual Input
1. Determine the rows and cols of the matrix
2. Fill in the matrix
3. Determine number of sequence
4. Fill in the sequence (without space and comma) and its respective score
5. Determine max buffer length
6. Press `Find Solution`button to find the optimal path, which will then be displayed in a modal popup window upon completion.
7. You are allowed to Save the result as long as a result exist (there is an optimal path).
